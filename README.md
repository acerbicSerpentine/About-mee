many things in this life bring me joy, such as spoiling my friend.. i love spending my money on other people.... or drawing an excessive amount of their ocs, or drawing them x their favourite character.. or making ocs for fandoms that i am not in just so we can talk about them..
</p>

<p align="center">
 YES i will watch the shows you recommend me, YES i will play your recommended games, YES i will listen to your favourite artists and YES i will listen to you yap and yap and yap for hours <333
